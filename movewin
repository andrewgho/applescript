(*
 * movewin - move a window to a position, and optionally resize it
 * Andrew Ho (andrew@zeuscat.com)
 *
 * Usage: movewin pattern x y [width height]
 *
 * The pattern is a string that case-insensitively matches any substring
 * in "Application Name - Window Title" of any windows visible in the
 * current space. The (x, y) coordinates and (width, height) dimensions
 * are also relative to the current space.
 *
 * Example: movewin 'Adium - Holly GoLightly' 1000 40 400 260
 *
 * This AppleScript requires the "Enable access for assistive devices"
 * setting to be enabled in the "Accessibility" System Preferences pane
 * in OS X pre-Mavericks. To enable assistive UI scripting in Mavericks,
 * see this Apple KB article: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5914
