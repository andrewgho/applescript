applescript - AppleScript utilities
===================================

This repository contains AppleScript utilities meant for running from
the command line (via the `osascript` command line utility in OS X).
In particular, the utilities are meant for UI scripting: reflecting on
and affecting the positions and sizes of windows.

Scripts
-------

`lswin` lists the application name, window title, position, and size of
every window open in the current space. You can optionally provide a
pattern substring that matches the `Application Name - Window Title`
output to restrict the windows that are listed.

`movewin` takes a pattern substring, X and Y coordinates for new window
position, and optionally a width and height in pixels. It moves the
first window that matches the pattern to the new location specified, and
also resizes it if the width and height are supplied.

`displaysize` prints the width and height of the current display (or
aggregate display, in the case of multiple monitors) in pixels.

`ctrl` is a simple command line utility which emits a given keystroke
with the `Ctrl` key modifier enabled. This is useful for switching to
different Mission Control spaces.

Prerequisites
-------------

All the scripts except for `displaysize` require the "Enable access for
assistive devices" setting to be enabled in the "Accessibility" System
Preferences pane in OS X pre-Mavericks. To enable assistive UI scripting
in Mavericks, see this Apple KB article:
