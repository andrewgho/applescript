(*
 * ctrl - send Ctrl+key from command line, for example, to move spaces
 * Andrew Ho (andrew@zeuscat.com)
 *
 * Usage: ctrl keystroke
 *
 * Keystroke is a single letter; the script just causes the first letter
 * of its input to be output with a Ctrl key modifier. One use of this is
 * to trigger a particular Mission Control space (for example, "ctrl 1" to
 * switch to the first space).
 *
 * Example: ctrl 1
 *
 * This AppleScript requires the "Enable access for assistive devices"
 * setting to be enabled in the "Accessibility" System Preferences pane
 * in OS X pre-Mavericks. To enable assistive UI scripting in Mavericks,
 * see this Apple KB article: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5914
