(*
 * lswin - list process name, title, size, and dimensions of open windows
 * Andrew Ho (andrew@zeuscat.com)
 *
 * Usage: lswin [pattern]
 *
 * The pattern is a string that case-insensitively matches any substring
 * in "Application Name - Window Title" of any windows visible in the
 * current space. If no pattern is specified, all windows in the current
 * space are shown.
 *
 * Example: lswin Adium
 *
 * This AppleScript requires the "Enable access for assistive devices"
 * setting to be enabled in the "Accessibility" System Preferences pane
 * in OS X pre-Mavericks. To enable assistive UI scripting in Mavericks,
 * see this Apple KB article: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5914
